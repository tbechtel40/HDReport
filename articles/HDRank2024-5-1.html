     <p class="blurbText">In Tristate, Papaya has picked up the reputation of being a flaker. Despite low attendance, everyone knows that if Papaya signs up for an event, even months after his last, he's a threat that shouldn’t be taken lightly. 
        <br><br>
        After taking a break from the game at the end of 2023, Papaya knew it was time to enter his first event in months. At Gigaton Hammer 2 with his signature Greninja, Papaya performed as if he never left, beating Exciled, Kamex, and Ravenking to place 9th. Losing to Face and stingers reminded him of the thrill of competing, and Papaya also had unfinished business from last year. He dedicated time to maining Falco with the goal of beating Mr. Mojo Risin’, who always ended his tourney runs. At Wolfie Wars, Papaya got his “lick back” on Face and bested his bracket demon Mr. Mojo Risin’ to win the tourney. Afterwards, Papaya decided to go back to his Pokémon roots, but instead of Greninja, he picked up Lucario. Fueled by the downplayers of said character, Papaya entered [bae] where he finished 3rd beating Abs, Kumatora, JM1-3, and finally Mlarcin in the Lucario ditto.
        <br><br>
        After [bae] Papaya decided to flake until Undertow, but unlike Gigaton Hammer 2, Papaya placed 17th losing to stingers again and Tyroy. Filled with motivation from this defeat, Papaya made the trip to Massachusetts for Wavelength’s shadow major Infrared. Leading up to the event Papaya grinded every day, including the night before the event where Papaya stayed up until 4 AM warming up against fellow rival Arhungry. With the dual combo of Greninja and Falco, Papaya was able to go the distance and win the event, defeating Mr. Mojo Risin’, Kero, Chrismus, Beast, and Anchor. Papaya earned his first major victory, something he still finds hard to believe. With a new season on the horizon, the question isn’t about whether Papaya will find more success, but what character, new or old, Papaya will pull out of his pocket.

     <img onclick="ToggleZoom('reImg2')" id="reImg2" class="article-potential-character article-body-image" src="/images/Article-images/2024 Top 50/5-1/4Arhungry.png" alt="" tabindex="0">
     <h2 class="blurbText">#4: Arhungry</h2>

     <p class="blurbText">There are very few players who can replicate the success and sheer consistency Arhungry had this season. He placed in the top 3 at all but two events in 2024, with those exceptions being two majors in Undertow and Infrared where he made top 8 at both events. Arhungry repeated his GOML victory, joining Frozen as the only other player to win the same major in back to back years. He even took a set from Frozen herself this year, defeating the Queen of HDR as well as Kamex, Beast, Mlarcin, and Papaya before Frozen won the grand finals reset at [bae], likely the most stacked 27 person event of all time. All of these accomplishments came after unfortunate circumstances sidelined him from attending Gigaton Hammer 2 at the beginning of the year.
        <br><br>
        Arhungry is stubborn in all the best ways for a competitor. If he can’t compete at one event, he’ll travel to three more to make up for it. If a character is overtuned, he’ll be sure to let everyone in the venue know before beating them anyways. Arhungry will be the first to tell you his character is broken too because that’s what it takes to win, and if there’s one thing to know about Arhungry, it’s that he really wants to win.
        <br><br>  
        In 2024 Arhungry was certainly winning a lot, and he isn’t shy about letting people know that. But chances are he won’t stop competing until he takes home the trophy at every event and makes everyone else realize the truth he’s known for years: he’s the best player in the world.

     <h2 class="blurbText">#3: Frosty</h2>

     <p class="blurbText">Following an incredible debut in the second half of the 2023 HDRank season, Frosty once again proved he is one of the most consistent players in competitive HewDraw Remix scene. Across the four tournaments he attended in 2024, the Simon Belmont main placed no lower than 3rd and only dropped sets to 2 players: Frozen and Rex. He’s also been a menace to his incredibly stacked local scene of Chicago, sitting at #1 on their most recent PR over a pool of other HDRank competitors. 
        <br><br>
        Frosty had an explosive start to the year with a first place finish at Frosty Faustings XVI, defending the homeland against Tristate invader Mlarcin and cleaning up against Chicago’s usual suspects Ozma and Ravenking. Following up his first tournament win of the year with over 30 players in attendance, he continued his hot streak by giving Frozen a run for her money at Super TPS III. A game 5 victory in winner’s finals puts Frosty on the short list of people that can say they have a win on the Caitlin Clark of modded party games. 
        <br><br>
        The reason Frosty’s 2024 season is somehow even better than the year before is because of his wins against the strongest players from the strongest regions in the game. At Undertow 2024, the most stacked event of the year, he racked up dominating victories on Androos, Kumatora, Asashi, and Arhungry, with a run to third place that Midwest players rarely get the chance to achieve. Frosty also found success in other competitive games through 2024 like Rivals 2, NASB2, and SF6. No matter what game he lands on in 2025, Frosty will stay a name to watch out for.

     <h2 class="blurbText">#2: Rex</h2>

     <p class="blurbText">Photo Credit: @JOEYFIGHTING</p>
     
     <p class="blurbText">When talking about HDR’s most dominant players, Rex appears near the top of that list. The former Duck Hunt main was ready to show that despite switching characters, he could once again win on the biggest stage. However, no story is complete without a little hardship as Rex struggled in the first half of the year.
        <br><br>
        Getting 17th place at Gigaton Hammer 2 didn’t leave Rex satisfied. Being the former #5 on HDRank 2023 and winning multiple regionals over Frozen, Rex knew he had to live up to that reputation. This started a streak where Rex was going through an arsenal of different characters and never placing below 5th at his next several events until a disappointing performance at [bae], going 0-2 losing to Kumatora and GatorHotFire. Long were the days when Rex was in grands finals versus Frozen at any given event. Even during these low moments, Rex would tell Frozen that she was lucky he didn’t get a chance to beat her in bracket, and Rex knew he had to prove it to her. After [bae], Rex decided to focus solely on playing Ivysaur.
        <br><br>
        As the summer came along so did the Rex of old, winning both of Tristate’s biggest regionals Creed III and Garden Brawl over Arhungry. Even though Rex was winning, his sights were set on facing off against one person. He knew his best chance to do so would be Undertow, where Rex took down essy, Birthdayninja, Kero, Buzzeh, Arhungry, Tyroy, and Frosty before finally reaching Frozen, his fated rival, in grands. Although Rex won the first set, Frozen would be the one to take home the trophy, yet Rex was finally satisfied despite the loss. He said afterwards “peak HDR is me versus Frozen. Getting that matchup in grands was something I had to do.” Capping off a successful year, Rex once again taught the doubters to not sleep on him. No matter what, Lord Rexington will always send his regards.

     <h2 class="blurbText">#1: Frozen</h2>

     <p class="blurbText">If you had a dollar for everytime Frozen was named the best at a competitive  modification for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate you would have TWO dollars, which isn’t a lot of money. But it’s a feat that only ONE person has pulled off as of, well, today! Defending her throne and keeping the title and crown of Queen of HDR upon her head is Frozen. Dropping only a handful of sets this season, Frozen once again showed dominance over the competition. With less of a reliance on her tried and true Aegis, Frozen tapped into her other characters including much more of her Robin, Rosalina, and a new addition in Palutena. Demonstrating that she is far from a one trick and that it’ll take much more than slaying one of her characters to keep her down, the question is who will be next to step up to take a swing at the Queen and her kingdom?
        <br><br>
        Although HDRank is only two years old, holding the title of best in the world  for both years is quite the achievement. After losing the first event of the year to Mugen at LMBM in January, some people questioned if Frozen would retain her title. Despite the doubts and the early stumble, Frozen bounced back and won every other event she entered for the rest of the year, showing that although she may bleed, her reign is supreme and it would take much much more to keep her from the top.
